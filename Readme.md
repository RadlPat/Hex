# Hex Game

## User Story
Hex is a game. You are suposed to play it against another human or against an KI. 


## Hex Rules

 - Players choose a colour and take turns. On each turn one counter is placed in an empty hexagonal cell.
 - Counters may not be moved except with the swap rule.
 - The first player to form a connected path of their counters linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colour wins.
 - The four corner hexagons belong to both adjacent sides.
 - Swap rule: on their first move the second player may move normally, or choose to swap their piece with that placed by the first player. [This encourages the first player to only choose a moderately strong first move and so reduces any advantage of going first. Ignore the swap rule for the first few games.]

 ## Plan
    - first i would just focus on the game and let it run on the terminal
    - human vs human first, then human vs KI
    - later i want to create an server an Website to play it online

### Terminal Hex
 - Separate it in Hex Game and Hex Board
